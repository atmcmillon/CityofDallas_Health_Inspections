Abstract: This project is a look into the health inspection reports conducted by the city of Dallas
from 2016 to 2020. It contains restaurant scores for each visit, the visit type, date, restaurant
name, and location; as well as comments from the inspector for the cleanliness and scores. The actual
.csv file is too heavy for Github to support, so it is available for free through the city of Dallas
311 website. I personally renamed the file to 'DallasHI2016toNow.csv'.

I intend to use this data project as practice for data analysis, and ask questions such as:

1. What are the highest and lowest scores reported, as well as median and average scores by:
a. The whole table
b. Each year
c. Each restaurant location

2. What are the unique restaurants inspected, given fast food chains can produce duplicates?
a. How many restaurants were inspected for each year?

3. Are there possible ways to predict trends in restaurant scores, and see if the worst offenders
ever get passing scores, or continue to fail?

Methodology: Python is a widely used and understood language by programmers and lay people alike,
so this will be my main file for writing queries, searching data, and cleaning data. Modules such
as Pandas, SweetViz, and NumPy are excellent libraries for data structuring and arranging.
Datetime is a good library for cleaning up columns with time-sensitive data.
